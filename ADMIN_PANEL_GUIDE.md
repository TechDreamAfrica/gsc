## Data Structure

### Firestore Collections
All data is stored in Firebase Firestore with the following collections:

1. **about** - About section content
2. **services** - All service offerings
3. **statistics** - Homepage statistics
4. **packages** - Service packages

Each document includes:
- `createdAt` - Timestamp when created
- `updatedAt` - Timestamp when last updated
- Other fields specific to the content type

## Security

### Authentication
- Only authenticated users with admin privileges can access the admin panel
- Admin privileges are set via Firebase custom claims
- Session persists until logout

### Authorization
- Firestore security rules ensure only admins can write data
- Public users can only read data
- All write operations require admin authentication

## Dynamic Content Loading

The main website pages ([index.html](index.html) and [services.html](services.html)) now include:
- Firebase SDK scripts
- [firebase-config.js](firebase-config.js) - Configuration
- [firebase-data.js](firebase-data.js) - Data loading logic

**How it works:**
1. When a page loads, it checks if Firebase is available
2. If yes, it loads dynamic content from Firestore
3. If no, it uses the static HTML content (fallback)

This means the website works even if Firebase is not configured yet!
