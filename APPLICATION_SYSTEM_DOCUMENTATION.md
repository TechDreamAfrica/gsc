## Security Implementation

### Email Whitelist

**Authorized Admin Emails**:

const AUTHORIZED_EMAILS = [
    'globalsmileconsulting@gmail.com',
    'admin@globalsmileconsulting.com'
];

function isAuthorizedEmail(email) {
    return AUTHORIZED_EMAILS.includes(email.toLowerCase().trim());
}
```

**Multi-Layer Verification**:
1. Check if user is authenticated
2. Verify email is in whitelist
3. Verify Firebase custom claims for admin role
4. Sign out and redirect if any check fails

---

## Reference Number System

**Format**: `GSC-XXXXX`

**Generation Logic**:
```javascript
const refNumber = 'GSC-' + Date.now().toString(36).toUpperCase();
```

**Example**: `GSC-LK5P2Q1R`

**Properties**:
- Unique based on timestamp
- Base36 encoding for compact representation
- Uppercase for consistency
- Prefixed with "GSC-" for branding

    match /services/{service} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }

    // Applications - create by all, read/write by admin
    match /applications/{application} {
